# Project Boilerplate Wiki

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Nuxt + Auth.js & Django + dj-rest-auth + DRF Boilerplate**!

This boilerplate provides a powerful, pre-configured environment for building web applications with:

- **Nuxt** (Vue-powered frontend)
- **Auth.js** (authentication management)
- **Django** (backend framework)
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** (API handling)
- **dj-rest-auth** (authentication for Django REST Framework)
- **Docker & Makefile** for simplified development and deployment

## What’s Inside?

This boilerplate is built on a solid tech stack to streamline development, including:

- **Nuxt** - Vue.js framework with SSR, SSG, and powerful routing
- **Auth.js** - Authentication for Nuxt, supporting various providers
- **Django** - Robust backend with Django ORM and admin panel
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** - API handling with full-featured serialization and permissions
- **dj-rest-auth** - Simplifies authentication flows like login, registration, password reset, and email verification
- **Docker & docker-compose** - Easy local and production environment setup

## Key Features

- ✅ **Pre-configured authentication** with Auth.js & dj-rest-auth
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication** with full frontend-backend integration
- ✅ **User authentication flows** (login, signup, email verification, password reset)
- ✅ **API-first architecture** powered by Django REST Framework
- ✅ **Social authentication** (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- ✅ **Production-ready setup** with Docker & `make`
- ✅ **Easily extendable** for custom business logic

## Getting Started
