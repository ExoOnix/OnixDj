# Project Boilerplate Wiki

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Nuxt + Auth.js & Django + dj-rest-auth + DRF Boilerplate**!  

This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building web applications with:  
- **Nuxt** (Vue-powered frontend)  
- **Auth.js** (authentication management)  
- **Django** (backend framework)  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** (API handling)  
- **dj-rest-auth** (authentication for Django REST Framework)  

With this setup, you get a pre-configured environment for full-stack development, including user authentication, API handling, and frontend integration.  

## Features

- âœ… Pre-configured **Auth.js** with Nuxt for authentication  
- âœ… Django backend with **dj-rest-auth** for token-based authentication  
- âœ… RESTful API setup using **Django REST Framework**  
- âœ… Seamless frontend-backend communication  
- âœ… **Client generation** for API consumption  
- âœ… Full authentication support, including **email/password authentication** and **social authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.)**  

This wiki will guide you through setup, usage, and customization of the boilerplate. ðŸš€
